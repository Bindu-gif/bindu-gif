# Public Health Disease Surveillance Architecture Development

## 📚 Project Overview
This project focuses on designing a scalable architecture for real-time public health disease surveillance. It supports early detection, monitoring, and mitigation of infectious disease outbreaks using data-driven technologies.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Create a disease surveillance pipeline.
- Simulate real-time data collection from public health APIs.
- Visualize disease trends across regions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- MongoDB  
- Flask  
- Power BI / Tableau

## 🧱 Architecture Components
- Data Sources: CDC, WHO, EHR APIs (simulated)
- Data Processing: Python ETL scripts
- Database: MongoDB
- Visualization: Power BI dashboard

## 💡 Challenges Faced
- Simulating real-time health data
- Handling inconsistent formats
- Ensuring data privacy in architecture

## ✅ Outcomes
- Built a working prototype for data flow
- Created a functioning dashboard
- Documented architecture for public health usage

## 👩‍💻 My Contributions
- Designed system architecture
- Developed Python scripts for data handling
- Created project documentation
