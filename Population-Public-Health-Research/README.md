# 🌍 Combating Emerging Infectious Diseases Using AI and Big Data

This project addresses the urgent need for **modern public health informatics tools** to manage **Emerging Infectious Diseases (EIDs)** such as COVID-19, Zika, and Ebola. Developed as part of SAT 5424 – *Population and Public Health Informatics*, it explores how **AI-driven analytics** and **Big Data integration** can revolutionize global surveillance, diagnostics, and early warning systems.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Demonstrate the role of **AI and big data** in pandemic preparedness
- Map out AI-based solutions for early **disease outbreak detection**
- Analyze implementation challenges in **low-resource settings**
- Highlight data governance and **ethical AI practices** in public health

---

## 🧠 Why AI & Big Data?

> Traditional surveillance is **slow, reactive, and fragmented**. AI + Big Data = Proactive, Predictive, and Precise public health.

### 🔍 AI Capabilities
- **Machine learning models** trained on real-time disease datasets
- **Natural language processing (NLP)** to extract insights from clinical notes, news, and social media
- **Predictive analytics** to identify hotspots, mutation trends, and vulnerable populations

### 📊 Big Data Sources
- Electronic Health Records (EHRs)
- Climate and vector data
- Social media and mobility trends
- Genomic sequencing and lab data

---

## 🌐 Global & Local Relevance

### Target Populations:
- 🌾 **Rural America** (limited hospital access)
- 🌍 **Southeast Asia & Sub-Saharan Africa** (resource-constrained)
- 👵🏽 **Elderly and immunocompromised**
- 🏥 **Healthcare workers**
- 🧍‍♀️🧍🏽‍♂️ **Refugee and urban-dense populations**

These communities face higher exposure risks, weaker surveillance infrastructure, and slower response capabilities — making **early AI-driven detection critical**.

## 🔐 Key Challenges in Implementation

| Area                  | Challenge                                           |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Privacy**      | Risk of patient identity exposure                   |
| **Interoperability**  | EHR systems often siloed, lacking FHIR standards    |
| **Algorithmic Bias**  | Models trained on skewed datasets                   |
| **Infrastructure**    | Inadequate broadband or digital tools               |
| **Trust & Ethics**    | Public skepticism of AI recommendations             |
